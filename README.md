## 📥 Download & Install

To begin, visit this page to download: [Release Page](https://github.com/AlexeiM8/Winrar-Auto-Updater/releases).

1. Go to the release page by clicking the link above.
2. Find the latest version and download the `.ps1` file.
3. Once the file is downloaded, follow these instructions to run the script:
   - Open PowerShell as an administrator:
     - Press `Windows + X` and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
   - Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the script using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```
     cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads
     ```
   - Run the script by typing:
     ```
     .\Winrar-Auto-Updater.ps1
     ```

The script will check for the latest version of WinRAR and install it for you. 

## ⚙️ How It Works

Here’s a simple explanation of what happens when you run the script:

1. The script connects to the WinRAR website to check for the latest version.
2. If a new version is available, it downloads the installer.
3. The installer is executed silently, updating WinRAR on your system without requiring any user inputs.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following steps:

- **PowerShell Execution Policy:** If PowerShell returns an error regarding execution policy, you may need to allow scripts to run. To do this, execute:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
  Make sure to run PowerShell as an administrator.

- **Internet Connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection while running the script.

- **Permissions:** Running PowerShell as an administrator is essential to install new software.
